headline: In a Fat Survey, a New Look at Graduate Student Sex Diversity in Science and Engineering

[overall]

text: From 1994 to 2005, female representation among graduate students in science and engineering rose by 10 percentage points.
maxYear: 2005

text: However, in the last decade, it declined to 40 again. It's since stagnated.

* Weâ€™ve found that while the representation of women has continued to be much more pronounced in medicinal and social science fields, the representation of women in many engineering and physical sciences fields has made little, no, or, even backwards progress.

* One such field is mechanical engineering.
