# Graduate Diversity

## Component design

`<App/>` reads the copy. It sends content into `content/` components and sends maxYear directions into `<ScatterRow/>` components.

`<ScatterRow/>` implements `react-scrollama` and controls whether `<PercentGraph/>` or `<PercentGraph/>` is visible. It sends numerical data and high-level instructions to these graphs.

`<PercentGraph/>` contains the graph framework and animates in data. It controls the placement of `<Line/>`'s and `<Point/>`'s.

`<PercentGraph/>` renders lines according to data from `<ScatterRow/>`.

`<Point/>` can also render a `<PointLabel/>`. The label can respect the space of another point.

## Notes

* When designing the connected scatter plot interactive, reference [this research](http://steveharoz.com/research/connected_scatterplot/) regarding theÂ UX and intelligibility of connected scatter plots.

* If there's extra time, Annotate differences in each time interval like this [Times graphic](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hKr9ETXwdj4/UFjJWm7daEI/AAAAAAAAAxI/O5EMLZTu5Zw/s1600/02metrics-popup-v3.jpg)
