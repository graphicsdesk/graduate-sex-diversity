headline: National Science Foundation Data Reveals Disparities in _____  Graduate Student Sex Diversity in Science and Engineering

[lede]

text: The percentage of women among graduate students in science and engineering fields is virtually unchanged since 1998.
field: TOTAL

text: But an Eye analysis of thirty subject areas in seven disciplines shows that, beneath this stagnation, the perpetuation, dismantling, and even widening of certain gender gaps is still very active, and they vary significantly by field.
field: ALL

text: In some fields, gender gaps seem to be have persisted by History. Among graduate students, men have dominated economics throughout the timeframe of this analysis, though the number of women has recent spiked.
field: Economics

text: Other gender gaps have set more recently: In physics, female percentage has fallen from 28 percent in 2007 to just 10 percent in 2016.
field: Physics

* Sex diversity among graduate students in science and engineering is virtually unchanged since 1998. The Eye analysis includes thirty one fields in seven broad areas. It extends from 1994, the earliest year that such institution-level, field-specific data was available from the National Science Foundation, to 2016, the most recent.

* The University’s only Arts and Sciences pipeline program, the Bridge to the Ph.D. in Natural Sciences, will be expanding next year to include all fields in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. “We do need our leading scholars in the nation to have the ability to assess or reassess themselves and we hope reports and having transparency in data can help us do those things,” Dennis Mitchell, Vice Provost for Faculty Advancement, said in an interview with Spectator last fall.

* The NSF data does not point to particular causes of the trends presented.

title: In many engineering fields, rapid growth leaves female students behind

scatter: Engineering

text: Each of the six engineering fields we analyzed saw a significant increase in their graduate student populations. Most exhibited a similar pattern during this growth: Male and female populations would grow together at first, often quite rapidly. Soon after, however, female population growth would slow, and the male population would continue to grow much faster.
