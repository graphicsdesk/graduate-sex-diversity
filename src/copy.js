headline: National Science Foundation Data Reveals Disparities in _____  Graduate Student Sex Diversity in Science and Engineering

[lede]

text: In 1994, there were 665 female and 1525 male graduate students in science and engineering.
maxYear: 1994

text: In the next couple of years, the female population saw a slight increase, and science and engineering graduate students drew closer to parity.
maxYear: 2000
guides: 0.25, 0.5, 0.75

text: Since 2004, the number of graduate students in science and engineering has grown dramatically due to considerable growth in engineering, mathematics, and physical sciences fields.
note: Columbia did not report data for several fields between 2001 and 2003. See the methodology at the end of this article for further details.

text: However, because the number of men has consistently grown faster than the number of women, female percentage among science and engineering graduate students has wavered around 40 for the last decade.

guides: 0.4, 0.5

text: But, this stagnation hides extremely disparate trendlines in gender representations among fields in science and engineering.
maxYear: 1993

text: During the timeframe of this analysis, despite a tenfold increase in size, the graduate students in statistics have maintained parity.
