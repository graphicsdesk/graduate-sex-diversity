## Notes

* Add little arrows to the connected scatter plot (see `notebooks/README.md`)

* When designing the connected scatter plot interactive, reference [this research](http://steveharoz.com/research/connected_scatterplot/) regarding theÂ UX and intelligibility of connected scatter plots.

* If there's extra time, annotate differences in each time interval like this [Times graphic](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hKr9ETXwdj4/UFjJWm7daEI/AAAAAAAAAxI/O5EMLZTu5Zw/s1600/02metrics-popup-v3.jpg)
